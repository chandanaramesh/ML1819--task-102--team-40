After implementing the selected pruning approach I have found out that RF seems to be the best model for the data as other models doesn't seem
to improve rmse. Model training and testing has been done wih number of attribute combinations like sets of sttribute with no lights, removing
all outdoor factors, removing appliances etc.

Slight overfitting was observed while incerasing the learning factor in GBM

Multiple linear regression and SVM are the worst performers.
